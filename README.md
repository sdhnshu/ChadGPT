    <em>Chad GPT, an LLM with local knowledge store</em>
</p>

---

Chad GPT is a tool to create / curate / incrementally build a local knowledge store. 

It can help us
- Create an incremental data store of our "business logic" that can be refined by human feedback
- Condense and store complex information (pdfs / code repos / documentations) into embeddings that can be queried using the chat interface (with links to sources)

Usecases:
- Brainstorming domain specific ideas that require a lot of textbook research
- Coding an application from a development spec sheet

2 very important plugins to be considered:
- Browsing
- Wolfram alpha

Add a meta prompting layer

Task management system should choose if you need to run a plugin very carefully
